# Text RPGs Engine

In very early development so no cool readme for now D:

### Practical plans

* Python because I'm lazy
* Terminal User Interface (TUI)
  - CUI is for programmers only and I am not a "front-end dude" to make decent GUI
  - I understand that Dwarf Fortress is a mess, I never played it though
* Exactly 1 test campaign
  - Other will be on different repos
  - The name will be: "Raid of the wicked"
* Support for playing with one hand
  - Keyboard, mouse if possible
* Visual art will be in two forms: portraits or pics between walls of text
  - I cannot draw or buy drawings right now so it'll be only calligraphy art for portraits
* Data model for all walls of text in a campaign
  - Bunch of txt files looks funny but it shouldn't be that way
 
### Abstract Plans

* Model of Cultivation Automated (MoCA, "C" reads like "K") for world simulation
  - It's text RPG so it's easiest way to make a "living" world
  - Exactly 3 levels of simulation
    * 1 One on one opposition
      * Skirmish, not a real battle
    * 2 Moral, vigor and skills test
      - For armies, groups and individuals
      - May lead to a total defeat with 100% casualties
    * 3 Massive Presence Expanding
      - Any big social simulations contains buildings or camps
      - Buildings do not "fight" however a garrison may defend itself, not a building

# Text RPGs Engine

In very early development so no cool readme for now D:

### Practical plans

* Python because I'm lazy
* Terminal User Interface (TUI)
  - CUI is for programmers only and I am not a "front-end dude" to make decent GUI
* Exactly 1 test campaign
  - Others will be in different repos
  - The name will be: "Raid of the wicked"
* Support for playing with one hand
  - Keyboard, mouse if possible
* Visual art will be in two forms: portraits or pics between walls of text
* Data model for all walls of text in a campaign
  - Bunch of txt files looks funny but it shouldn't be that way
 
### Abstract Plans

* "Sparse Forest" system for world simulation
  - It's text RPG so it's easiest way to make a "living" world
  - Exactly 3 layers
    * Opposition
      - Skirmish, not a real battle
    * Moral, vigor and skills test
      - For armies, groups and individuals
    * "Social Presence" system
      - Any big social simulation contains buildings or camps
      - Buildings do not "fight" however a garrison may defend itself, not a building

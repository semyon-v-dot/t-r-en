# Text RPGs Engine

In very early development so no cool readme for now D:

Plans: 
* Terminal User Interface (TUI)
  - CUI is for programmers only and I am not a "front-end dude" to make decent GUI
  - I understand that Dwarf Fortress is a mess, I never played it though
* Exactly 1 test campaign
  - Other will be on different repos
  - The name will be: "Raid of the wicked"
* Abstract border between creative system and numerical one
  - For example, names of classes — creative system, points of health — numerical system
  - Unification is impossible (or too complex for me) but I'll try anyway
* Model of Cultivation Automated (MoKA)
  - It's text RPG so it's easiest way to make a "living" world
* Python because I'm lazy

# Text RPGs Engine

In very early development so no cool readme for now D:

Practical plans:
* Terminal User Interface (TUI)
  - CUI is for programmers only and I am not a "front-end dude" to make decent GUI
  - I understand that Dwarf Fortress is a mess, I never played it though
* Exactly 1 test campaign
  - Other will be on different repos
  - The name will be: "Raid of the wicked"
* Support for playing with one hand, left and right
  - Keyboard or mouse
  - There is very specific reason for this but I won't tell it (:
* Visual art will be in two forms: portraits or pics between walls of text
  - I cannot draw or buy drawings right now so it'll be only calligraphy art for portraits
* Python because I'm lazy

Abstract plans: 
* Border between creative system and numerical one
  - For example, names of classes — creative system, points of health — numerical system
  - Unification on the matter is impossible (or too complex for me) but I'll try anyway
* Model of Cultivation Automated (MoCA) for world simulation
  - It's text RPG so it's easiest way to make a "living" world

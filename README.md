# Text RPGs Engine

In very early development so no cool readme for now D:

### Practical plans

* Python
* GUI
* Test campaign in different repo
  - The name will be: "Raid of the wicked"
  - It'll be not in English
* Support for playing with one hand
  - Keyboard or mouse
* Visual art will be in two forms: portraits or pics between walls of text
* Data model for all walls of text in a campaign
  - Bunch of txt files looks funny but it shouldn't be that way
 
### Abstract Plans

* World simulation
  - It's text RPG so it's easiest way to make a "living" world
* Opposition
  - Skirmish, not a real battle
* Moral, vigor and skills test
  - For armies, groups and individuals
* Society Presence
  - Any big social simulation contains buildings or camps
  - Buildings do not "fight" however a garrison may defend itself, not a building
